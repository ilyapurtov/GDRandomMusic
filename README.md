# GDRandomMusic
Randomize your geometry dash menu music!

- Extract downloaded archive in geometry dash location directory.
- Then you can run geometry dash using the GDRandomMusic.exe.
- You can add or remove music from MenuSongs directory.

When you run GDRandomMusic.exe, it randomly chooses a song from /MenuSongs directory and replaces menuLoop.mp3 in resources folder with choosed music.

There are cool songs in the archive by default :)

Enjoy!
